Undergrad Mini Project
•Implemented an intelligent college enquiry chatbot using Tensorflow, Recurrent Neural Networks and Keras Deep learning library.
•Chatbot deployed on the college website to answer frequently asked questions about courses and programs.
•Used Tensorflow and deep learning libraries to provide accurate and relevant responses to user inquiries.
•Recurrent Neural Networks used to process and analyze large amounts of text data for natural language processing.
•Trained the chatbot using a large dataset of previous college inquiries to improve its response generation abilities.
•Improved user experience by providing instant and technical answers to their questions without the need for manual intervention.
